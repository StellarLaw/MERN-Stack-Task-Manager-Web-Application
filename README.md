# MERN Task Management Web Application

## Project Overview
This Task Management Web Application is being developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It is designed to help users and organizations manage tasks, collaborate within teams, and track deadlines efficiently. The app provides role-based permissions, allowing administrators to manage users, assign tasks, and set task priorities. It also features calendar integration to visualize deadlines and monitor progress.

## Key Features
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure login system using JWT authentication.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admins can assign tasks to team members, manage roles, and track progress.
- **Calendar Integration**: View tasks and deadlines in a calendar format, with color-coded priorities.
- **Organization Creation**: Users can create or join organizations to collaborate on tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Calendar Integration**: FullCalendar

## Installation

## Future Usage
Once the server and frontend are running, you can:
- Register or log in to your account.
- Create personal tasks or manage tasks within an organization.
- View tasks in a dashboard and calendar.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Admins can assign tasks to team members and monitor progress.

## Roadmap
### Current Focus
